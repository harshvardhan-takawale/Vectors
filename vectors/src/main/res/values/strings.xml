    <string name="about_vectors">To use the app, just press "Start Vectors" on the home screen and leave the app running in the background. The app will automatically try to connect to nearby devices for exchanging data.\n\nVectors is a research project at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus for studying the effectiveness of using Delay Tolerant Networks for sending user-generated Video. This project uses the Scalable Video Codec (SVC) for encoding video data. \n\nAndroid phones are used as nodes for relaying the data. Using the Google Nearby API, the app optimises the sending of data over Bluetooth to minimise power consumption and storage space used.\n\nPlease fill out the below Google Form to help us track your participation for the month of April 2018.</string>
